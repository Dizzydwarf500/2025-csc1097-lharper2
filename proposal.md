### Introduction

> The purpose of this project is to develop a softwre for Dublin Airport Authorities to improve the way coordiantors manage officers break. This is an ongoing problem which I will be taking on trying to make a system that makes it easier to keep track of everyones breaks.


### Outline

> This application will be used across both Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 to help with giving officers breaks and also work as an assistant in keeping track of peoples positions so they can be found and sent on break sooner ensuring a more efficient operation which will reduce the chance of breaking any compliance code of conducts

### Background

> The idea came from working in the airport for almost a year and a half and doing research into scheduling and learning more about how the DAA handles there officers breaks. I decided to throw around a few ideas and designs until I was happy with something I could present.

### Achievements

> This project will be substantial for me and for the Dublin Airport Authorities as it makes coordinators jobs easier and provides a better work environment to avoid anyone missing there breaks due to human error. This also has further prospect for more advanced features in the future.

### Justification

> Why/when/where/how will it be useful? This project will be useful as it will imrpove the operation. My goal for the first demo with a private group in december. It will be useful to the DAA. It will also be a good oportunity to collect data that can benefit the DAA further.

### Programming language(s)

> Javascript will be the main programming language.

### Programming tools / Tech stack

> Django will be used for the backend and react will be used for the front end any data has been supplied by the DAA.

### Hardware

> No Hardware components are used.

### Learning Challenges

> I will be learning about sorting different information from databases and will have to learn more about scheduling and how the DAA operation works as a whole.

### Breakdown of work

> Clearly identify who will undertake which parts of the project.
>
> It must be clear from the explanation of this breakdown of work both that each student is responsible for
> separate, clearly-defined tasks, and that those responsibilities substantially cover all of the work required
> for the project.

#### Student 1

> I will be doing all of the project as I have identification and permission to access sensitive information provided by the DAA.

#### Student 2

> *Student 2 should complete this section.*
